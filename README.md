# 🛡️ Protect Word Documents using GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET

## 📖 About This Repository

This repository demonstrates practical implementations of **GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET, a tool for protecting Microsoft Word documents using various watermarking techniques.

The examples show how to: - Add simple and tiled text watermarks
- Lock headers and specific document sections with passwords
- Use editable content ranges to balance protection and usability
- Combine Word editing restrictions with GroupDocs.Watermark APIs

These implementations are designed for developers who want to move beyond Microsoft Word's basic watermark feature and use professional .NET routines for document protection.

## 💡 The Challenge

### What is GroupDocs.Watermark?

[**GroupDocs.Watermark for .NET**](https://docs.groupdocs.com/watermark/net/) is a powerful **document watermarking API** that allows developers to protect, brand,
and secure Word, PDF, Excel, PowerPoint, and over 40 other file formats programmatically.

**Key capabilities:** - Add, search, and remove watermarks of any type
- Lock watermarks with password protection
- Protect against unauthorized removal
- Automate watermarking for large-scale document processing
- Works without Microsoft Office --- pure .NET implementation

It's ideal for legal contracts, confidential reports, and branded client documents.

## ⚙️ Pre-requirements

To protect Word documents effectively, you can use one or more of the following methods:

1.  **Header watermark** -- Simple watermark added to the document header. Easy to implement, but can be manually removed.
2.  **Tiled watermark** -- Multiple repeated text instances across the page, making removal tedious.
3.  **Password-protected section** -- Watermark placed in a locked section, editable only with a password.
4.  **Locked header + editable ranges** -- Header area (with watermark) locked for editing, while selected body areas remain editable.
5.  **Full document restriction** -- Document locked using WordProcessingLockType with read-only or form-field access.

These methods are fully demonstrated in the included code examples. Each approach builds upon the previous one, offering increasing levels of
security.
